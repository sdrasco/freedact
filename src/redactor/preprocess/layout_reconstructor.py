"""Layout reconstruction utilities.

Purpose:
    Rebuild document structure from segmented text to support block-level redaction.

Key responsibilities:
    - Group related lines into blocks such as addresses or party sections.
    - Track original character offsets for precise replacement.

Inputs/Outputs:
    - Inputs: sequence of text segments with offsets.
    - Outputs: structured blocks with span information.

Public contracts (planned):
    - `reconstruct(segments)`: Yield blocks representing logical layout units.

Notes/Edge cases:
    - Full-block replacement is used to prevent partial leakage of sensitive data.

Dependencies:
    - Standard library only.
